## Submission for Intertech Media Front End Engineer

This project serves as my offical submission for the second (and hopefully last) coding test for the role of Front End Engineer.
This app utilizes the [Angular Matierlal] (https://material.angular.io/) components.

The following additional components are user:

* [Angular2Moment] (https://github.com/urish/angular2-moment)
* [ng-pick-datetime] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-pick-datetime)

# Known Issues

The ng test will output numerous errors.  Some I have addressed; others, I have not because I am not sure how. I have scoured stackOverflow 
and google looking for solutions but to no avail.
